Personal Finance Tracker is a secure, web-based financial management application built with Python Flask that enables users to track their income and expenses across multiple currencies (USD and INR) and organize transactions into customizable "rooms" for different life contexts like Personal, Business, Travel, and more. The application features a complete user authentication system with secure login/signup functionality, ensuring each user's financial data remains private and isolated. Users can add, edit, delete, and categorize transactions while viewing real-time financial summaries, interactive expense charts, and detailed analytics including balance calculations and savings rates for both currencies. The responsive web interface works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices, offering features like room-based filtering, transaction history management, and comprehensive data reset options with safety confirmations. Built with modern web technologies including Bootstrap for UI, Chart.js for visualizations, and secure session management, the application is deployment-ready for cloud platforms like Heroku, Railway, or Render, making it accessible from anywhere with proper data persistence through JSON file storage and user-specific data isolation for multi-user environments.
